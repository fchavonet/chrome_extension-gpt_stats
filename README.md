# GPT Stats

## Description

GPT Stats is a lightweight Chrome extension that tracks [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) usage effortlessly. It automatically measures the time you spend, counts your prompts, and displays useful usage statistics, all in a clean and minimal popup interface.

All data is stored locally in your browser using `chrome.storage.local`, ensuring full control, offline compatibility, and compliance with modern extension security standards.

Whether you're curious about your productivity, want to better understand your usage habits and environmental impact, or just love data, GPT Stats gives you clear insights without compromising performance or privacy.

## Objectives

- Track the time spent on ChatGPT.
- Count the number of prompts sent.
- Provide a visual dashboard using `Chart.js`.
- Estimate water consumption based on usage patterns.
- Persist usage data across browser sessions.
- Ensure everything works offline, locally, with no external dependencies.
